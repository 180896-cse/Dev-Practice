// Given an input string and positive integer N, returns a ROT-N
// copy of the string.

// NOTE: the value 65 is A, the same way to print B, we need to pass the value of 66 and so on. Therefore, to print A to Z, all we have to do is to pass the value from 65 to 91. And, for small letters, it will be 97 to 123

    for(let i =0;i<str.length;i++){
